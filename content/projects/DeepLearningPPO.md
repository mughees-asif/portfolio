Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm used to train an agent to balance an inverted double pendulum, that serves as a baseline study into advanced astrodynamical control systems, such as docking and berthing of spacecraft, and rocket trajectory stabilisation. I am under the supervision of (Dr. Angadh Nanjangud)[https://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/a.nanjangud] (Lecturer in Aerospace/Spacecraft Engineering @ School of Engineering & Material Sciences).
